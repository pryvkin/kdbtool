# kdbtool
# A command line tool for merging KeePassX 1.X databases

### USAGE:
./kdbtool merge FILE1.kdb FILE2.kdb OUTFILE.kdb

Will prompt for password (assumes password is same for both files)

### Bugs/missing:
 No support for keyfile (just master password)
 Assumes password is same on both files
 Ordering of groups and entries changes when merging
   (need to take idx into acct)
 Probably still leftovers from the GUI version that can be removed
   Excessive #includes
 Not sure about multi-platform support
 Consider De-QTifying the whole thing
